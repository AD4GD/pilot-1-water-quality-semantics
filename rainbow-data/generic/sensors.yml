    description: |
      RDO® Blue uses In-Situ’s patented Optical Rugged Dissolved Oxygen technology, an EPA-approved dissolved oxygen measurement method ideal for measuring DO and temperature in even the harshest environments. Suitable for handheld use or long-term deployment in fresh water or saltwater, this low-maintenance dissolved oxygen probe offers robust performance at a lower cost than other DO meters.
      RDO Blue requires no calibration or conditioning prior to deployment and doesn’t use membranes. The replaceable RDO Smart Sensor Cap stores calibration coefficients for automatic, error-free setup. And a unique, three-layer system provides unmatched chemical and abrasion resistance.
      Use included Modbus/RS485 communication protocol to easily integrate with PLC systems or telemetry with HydroVu data services for real-time feedback and process control.

    manufacturers:
      - in-situ
    description: |
      The RDO PRO-X Dissolved Oxygen Probe uses optical technology (EPA-approved RDO technology for Clean Water Act programs) to measure dissolved oxygen and temperature in demanding process environments. This durable probe requires no calibration or conditioning prior to deployment and does not use membranes. The replaceable RDO Smart Sensor Cap stores calibration coefficients for automatic, error-free setup.
      Use flexible communication protocols (4-20 mA, Modbus/RS485, or SDI-12) and easily integrate with PLC systems, telemetry systems and/or HydroVu Data services for real-time feedback within your system.
      With the RDO PRO-X, NPDES permit holders can monitor influent, effluent and treatment processes and respond quickly to oxygen and temperature changes for more accurate and efficient process control.
